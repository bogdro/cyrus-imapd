Description:

Support user and lmtp rate limits in lmtp


Config changes:

This changes the behaviour of the maxlogins_per_user and maxlogins_per_host
configuration options to limit each item per service, so 5 logins from a
host for imap won't also limit http logins.

It also limits lmtp connections for delivery to a locked mailbox,
returning a 4xx code if additional connections are made that try to
deliver to the same mailbox if there are already N connections waiting.


Upgrade instructions:

No config changes required, it's rare that you have more than one LMTP
connection waiting on a mailbox so it's very unlikely that existing
limits will affect lmtp - though you may want to double check that your
limits still make sense given that each service now has a separate count.
