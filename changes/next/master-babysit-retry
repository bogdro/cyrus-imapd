Description:

master: retry all DAEMON block services and services with the 'babysit' flag forever


Config changes:

No config changes


Upgrade instructions:

Nothing required for upgrade.  You may wish to add 'babysit' to a service,
which will not only ensure that there's always one forked, but if it dies
too frequently, it won't stay dead.
